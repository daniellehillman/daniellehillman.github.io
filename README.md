# Danielle Hillman's Wesbite

Created by me: *Danielle Hillman*

## This is my website that includes pages such as Home/About me, Portfolio, and Contact page.

Most web browsers host this site. 

### Home/About Me

This page has information about me, a photo of me, and my skills. Icons were used from Bootstrap.

### Portfolio

This page will include all projects that have been completed with links.

### Contact

This page has links to all my social media and a place to send me an message.

The message *send* button does not link to anything, since we have not learned Javascript for that. 

## Main Points of Website

To fully utilize the assignment for this website, all three pages use containers, rows, and columns.
Once the website is condensed, the responsive nav bar becomes a dropdown and able to be used on smaller screens. 


## Added features
Javascript and Bootstrap were both used for styling. 

## Future Updating
As more projects are completed and skills are gained, this website will be consistently updated and improved upon.
